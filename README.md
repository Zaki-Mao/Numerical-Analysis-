# Numerical Analysis 
 
You can get all the homework here for the numerical-analysis.

If you want to download the files, one way is using the git clone but if you do not have git, just simply clink the download zip and you can get the files.

I may have many errors in the tex files and you may can change the errors.
If you want to change the errors, you should rather learn how to use the github first and when you want to change something, please add a comment with it.

You may also create a new branch and add comment.

I'm very happy to see you can get what you want here!
