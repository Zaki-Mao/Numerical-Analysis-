 Numerical Analysis 
 
You can get all the homework here for the numerical-analysis.
I may have many errors in the tex files and you may can change the errors.
If you want to change the errors, you should rather learn how to use the github first and when you want to change something, please add a comment with it.
You may also create a new branch and add comment.

I'm very happy to see you can get what you want here!
